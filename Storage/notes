## Cloud Storage
Provides scalable, durable, and secure storage over the internet.
Pay for what you use (no upfront hardware).
Used for files, databases, backups, and archives.

## AWS Storage Services

# Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
Object storage (store files as objects, not blocks).
Highly durable (99.999999999% → 11 nines).
Scalable & cost-effective.
Storage classes: Standard, Intelligent-Tiering, One Zone-IA, Glacier (for archival).
Features: Versioning, Lifecycle policies, Encryption, Access Control.
Use cases: Backups, media storage, data lakes, static website hosting.

# Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)
Block storage for EC2 instances.
Like a hard drive you attach to a VM.
Persistent → data remains after stopping an instance.
Types: General Purpose SSD, Provisioned IOPS SSD, Throughput Optimized HDD, Cold HDD.
Use cases: Databases, OS boot volumes, transactional apps.

# Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)
File storage that multiple EC2 instances can share.
Fully managed, scalable (grows/shrinks as you add/remove files).
NFS protocol support.
Use cases: Shared content repositories, big data analytics.

# Amazon FSx
Managed file systems.
Types:
FSx for Windows File Server (Windows apps).
FSx for Lustre (high-performance workloads like ML, HPC).
Use cases: Enterprise file shares, HPC workloads.

# Amazon S3 Glacier & Glacier Deep Archive
Low-cost archival storage.
Retrieval times: minutes to hours.
Use cases: Compliance archives, backups, long-term storage.

# AWS Storage Gateway
Hybrid storage service (connects on-premises with AWS).
Types: File Gateway, Volume Gateway, Tape Gateway.
Use cases: Backup & disaster recovery, cloud bursting.

# AWS Snow Family
Physical devices for moving data in/out of AWS.
Snowcone (small), Snowball (medium), Snowmobile (huge truck for exabytes).
Use cases: Data migration, edge computing.

## Storage Use Cases

S3 → General object storage, backups, static websites.
EBS → VM hard drives, databases, apps needing fast performance.
EFS → Shared storage across multiple EC2s.
FSx → Specialized workloads (Windows apps, HPC).
Glacier → Long-term archive.
Storage Gateway → Hybrid on-prem + cloud.
Snow Family → Bulk data transfer.

## Best Practices

Use the right storage class for cost optimization.
Enable S3 Versioning for data protection.
Use Lifecycle Policies to move data automatically between storage classes.
Encrypt data at rest (KMS) and in transit (SSL/TLS).

Monitor with CloudWatch + CloudTrail.
