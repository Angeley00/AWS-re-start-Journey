ðŸ”‘ Core Compute Concepts

Elasticity â†’ Automatically scale resources up/down based on demand.

Pay-as-you-go â†’ You only pay for what you use (no need to buy servers upfront).

Global availability â†’ Deploy applications worldwide with low latency.

âš¡ Main AWS Compute Services

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

Virtual servers in the cloud.

You can choose CPU, memory, storage, and networking.

Common for hosting apps, websites, and backend systems.

Amazon Lightsail

Simplified compute for beginners (pre-configured with OS + apps).

Great for small websites, blogs, and dev/test environments.

AWS Lambda (Serverless)

Run code without provisioning servers.

Event-driven: executes when triggered (e.g., file uploaded to S3).

Pay only for the execution time.

Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) & EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

Run and manage containers (Docker, Kubernetes).

For microservices and modern app architectures.

AWS Fargate

Serverless compute for containers.

No need to manage servers or clusters.

AWS Batch

Run batch computing jobs at any scale.

Often used for scientific research, big data, and analytics.

Amazon Elastic Beanstalk

PaaS (Platform as a Service).

Deploy apps quickly (just upload code â†’ AWS handles scaling & infrastructure).

AWS Outposts / Local Zones / Wavelength

Extend AWS compute services closer to users or on-premises.
