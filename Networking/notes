## What is Cloud Networking?
Provides connectivity between cloud resources, users, and the internet.
Ensures secure, fast, reliable communication in AWS.
Networking in AWS is built around the VPC (Virtual Private Cloud).

## Core AWS Networking Services
 
# Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

A logically isolated network in AWS.

You define:
Subnets (public/private).
Route tables (control traffic).
Internet Gateway (access to internet).
NAT Gateway (private subnet → internet access).
Security Groups (instance-level firewalls).
NACLs (Network ACLs → subnet-level firewalls).
Use case: Hosting apps securely in isolated networks.

# Amazon Route 53
Scalable DNS (Domain Name System) service.
Routes users to applications globally.
Supports: Domain registration, DNS resolution, health checks, routing policies (weighted, latency-based, failover, geolocation).

# Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
Distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets (EC2, containers, Lambda).

Types:
ALB (Application Load Balancer) → HTTP/HTTPS.
NLB (Network Load Balancer) → TCP/UDP, high performance.
CLB (Classic Load Balancer) → Legacy.

# Amazon CloudFront
A Content Delivery Network (CDN).
Caches content at edge locations for low-latency delivery.
Works with S3, EC2, and ALBs.
Use case: Global websites, video streaming.

# AWS Transit Gateway
Connects multiple VPCs and on-premises networks.
Central hub for simplifying large-scale networking.

## Networking Use Cases

VPC → Isolated secure environment for apps.
Route 53 → Domain names, traffic routing.
ELB → High availability and scaling apps.
CloudFront → Speed up content delivery worldwide.
Direct Connect / VPN → Hybrid cloud.
Global Accelerator → Improve global app performance

## Best Practices

Use multiple AZs for fault tolerance.
Keep public and private subnets separated.
Use NAT Gateway for private instances needing internet.
Enable monitoring & logging (VPC Flow Logs, CloudWatch).
Apply least privilege access with Security Groups & IAM.
