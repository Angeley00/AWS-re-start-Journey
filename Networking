## AWS Networking Services
- **Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** â†’ Isolated network for resources.  
- **Subnets** â†’ Divide VPC into public/private networks.  
- **Route Tables** â†’ Define traffic flow rules.  
- **Internet Gateway (IGW)** â†’ Enables internet access.  
- **NAT Gateway** â†’ Allows private instances to access the internet.  
- **Security Groups & NACLs** â†’ Control inbound/outbound traffic.  
- **Amazon Route 53** â†’ DNS service.

## Key Concepts
- CIDR blocks for IP address ranges.  
- Public vs Private subnets.  
- High availability across multiple AZs.  
- Shared responsibility in securing networks.
